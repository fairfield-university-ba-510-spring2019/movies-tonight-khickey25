It provides information about every movie shown in Riverside, California, on Thanksgiving 1996. The code is ancient –– Javascript was just 2 years old at the time –– and won’t work in some modern browsers. It should work fine in Chrome and Firefox, however."

Each record is on a line and is one of three types (M, S, and T). Depending on the record type, the last field may be repeated if there are multiple values, making the # of fields variable (even when the record type doesn’t change).\n",
    "- **Format 2** is a slightly different arrangement, again with three record types. This time the repeated fields are split into separate records. To conserve characters in the file, fields are left blank if the values are the same in the record above it.\n",
    "- **Format 3** combines all three record types into a single record, at the cost of being extremely verbose and redundant. Notice how many rows the sheet has! Each record represents a single **movie credit** within a single **movie showing** at a given time at a **single theater**. (Read that three times to be sure you understand before going on.)     \n",
